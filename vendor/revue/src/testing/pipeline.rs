//! Full-pipeline test harness.
//!
//! [`TestApp`](super::TestApp) and [`Snapshot`](crate::core::app::Snapshot) render a
//! view by calling [`View::render`] against a bare
//! [`RenderContext`](crate::widget::RenderContext). That path never builds the
//! DOM, never runs the CSS cascade, never computes layout, and leaves
//! `RenderContext::state` as `None` - so it cannot observe anything that
//! depends on [`NodeState`], computed style, or dirty tracking.
//!
//! [`PipelineHarness`] instead drives the *real* [`App::draw`] against an
//! in-memory writer. Every frame goes through the same sequence as a running
//! application:
//!
//! ```text
//! update_dom_and_get_root -> compute_styles_with_inheritance
//!   -> update_layout_tree (harness only, see `layout_engine`) -> render_to_buffer
//!   -> diff -> terminal
//! ```
//!
//! Use this for any test that must not drift from production behavior:
//! reconciliation, node identity, state ownership, invalidation scope.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use revue::testing::PipelineHarness;
//!
//! let mut h = PipelineHarness::with_css("button { color: cyan; }", 40, 10);
//! h.draw(&my_view);
//! assert!(h.screen_text().contains("Save"));
//! assert!(h.node_state("save-btn").is_some());
//! ```
