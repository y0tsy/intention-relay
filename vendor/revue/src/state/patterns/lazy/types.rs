//! Core types and enums for lazy loading patterns

/// Loading state for lazy data
///
/// Represents the current state of data that is being loaded asynchronously.

///
/// # States
///
/// - **Idle** - Data has not been loaded yet
/// - **Loading** - Data is currently being fetched
/// - **Loaded** - Data has been successfully loaded
/// - **Failed** - Loading attempt failed
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use revue::patterns::lazy::LoadState;
///
/// fn render_status(state: LoadState) -> &'static str {
///     match state {
///         LoadState::Idle => "Press enter to load",
