//! One-shot execution utility
//!
//! A simple utility to ensure a callback is executed only once.

//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use revue::utils::Once;
//!
//! let mut once = Once::new();
//! for _ in 0..10 {
//!     if once.call() {
//!         println!("This will only print once!");
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
